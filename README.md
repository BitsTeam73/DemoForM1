### Explanation of the folder structure:

- **`.github/workflows/main.yml`**: This file contains the GitHub Actions configuration for continuous integration (CI). It sets up the necessary pipeline stages like linting, testing, and model training.
  
- **`src/train.py`**: This script contains the code for training the machine learning model. It loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance.

- **`tests/test_model.py`**: This is the test file used to validate that the model training script is working correctly. It uses `pytest` to run the tests and ensures that the model is saved correctly after training.

- **`models/`**: This directory stores the trained model file (e.g., `model.pkl`). This folder is where the trained model artifact is saved.

- **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists all the dependencies required for the project, including libraries like `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `pytest`, etc.
